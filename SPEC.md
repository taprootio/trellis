# Trellis Backlog Spec

**Version:** 2.1.0 · **Status:** stable

Trellis is a tool-agnostic convention for running a software backlog as plain
files in a git repository. Work items are Markdown files with YAML front-matter;
a generator validates them and produces a human index and a machine-readable
`backlog.json`; CI gates the repo so the index can never drift. This document is
the canonical specification, intended to be vendored into any repository
unchanged.

This spec describes the backlog **format and artifacts** — the data, the
generated outputs, and the tooling contract. It does not prescribe a *process*
for working items (planning, review, branching); those layer on top and are
specified separately.

## 1. Concepts

- **Item** — one unit of tracked work, stored as a single Markdown file.
- **Status** — `active`, `completed`, or `removed`. An item has exactly one,
  reflected by which directory it lives in.
- **Generator** — a program that validates items and regenerates the derived
  artifacts (`README.md` tables and `backlog.json`).
- **Config** — `backlog.config.json`, the per-repo vocabulary (id prefix,
  milestones, priorities, effort scale) that lets the same generator serve any
  repo.

The per-item files are the single source of truth. The index and `backlog.json`
are derived and must never be hand-edited.

## 2. Repository layout

```
<repo>/
  trellis/
    backlog.config.json            # per-repo configuration (§7)
    team.json                      # optional team roster (§7.2)
    active/<ID>.md                 # open items (§5)
    completed/
      tasks/<ID>.md                # finished items, history preserved
      index.md                     # GENERATED list of completed items (§8.1)
    removed/<ID>.md                # abandoned items, archived
    removed/index.md               # GENERATED list of removed items (§8.1)
    README.md                      # GENERATED human index (§8.1)
    backlog.json                   # GENERATED machine index (§8.2)
    assets/effort/                 # optional effort-scale images (§6.3)
```

The **backlog root** defaults to `trellis/` at the repo root and is configurable
per repo via the `tasksDir` key (§7) — a repo whose static-site generator
publishes one directory (e.g. Eleventy over `docs/`) can repoint it elsewhere.
The **config file** is always `trellis/backlog.config.json`, a fixed location
independent of `tasksDir`: tooling must be able to find the config before it
knows where the task tree lives. Above, `tasksDir` is its default (`trellis/`),
so the config and the task tree share one folder. Everything inside an item
file's body is free-form Markdown.

## 3. Identifiers

An id is a configured **prefix** followed by a zero-padded **number** of a
configured width — e.g. with prefix `AB` and width 4, `AB0042`.

- The id MUST match the item's filename (`AB0042` ⇄ `AB0042.md`).
- Ids are assigned monotonically from the **Next task ID** published in the
  generated `README.md`.
- An id is permanent and globally unique across all three directories. It MUST
  NOT be reused, even after an item is removed.

## 4. Status lifecycle

```
          create
            │
            ▼
        [ active ] ──── ship ────▶ [ completed ]   → completed/tasks/
            │
            └──────── drop ───────▶ [ removed ]     → removed/  (with reason)
```

- There is **no on-hold status.** Park low-priority work as a low-priority
  `active` item, or remove it with a `removed_reason` that names the trigger to
  revisit.
- Transitions are a file **move** plus front-matter edits (§5), made in the same
  change that ships or drops the work, followed by a generator run.
- History is preserved: completing or removing an item moves the file (keeping
  its git history); it is never deleted.

## 5. Item file format

An item file is YAML front-matter delimited by `---`, followed by a Markdown
body.

### 5.1 Front-matter schema

| field | active | completed | removed | rule |
| --- | :-: | :-: | :-: | --- |
| `id` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | matches the filename |
| `title` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | one line |
| `status` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | matches the directory |
| `summary` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | one sentence; feeds the README table |
| `milestone` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | a configured milestone (§7.1); historical on closed items |
| `priority` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | a configured priority (§7); historical on closed items |
| `effort` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | a configured effort value (§6); historical on closed items |
| `depends_on` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | list of existing ids (`[]` if none) |
| `owner` | ○ | ○ | ○ | a roster handle (§7.2); active → an active member; historical on closed |
| `collaborators` | ○ | ○ | ○ | list of roster handles; active → active members; historical on closed |
| `completed_on` | – | ✓ | – | ISO date (`YYYY-MM-DD`) |
| `removed_on` | – | – | ✓ | ISO date |
| `removed_reason` | – | – | ✓ | one line; why, and any trigger to revisit |

(○ = optional.) `owner` and `collaborators` are optional everywhere and reference
the team roster (§7.2); no item need carry them, and no backfill is required.

On close (completed or removed), the descriptive metadata — `milestone`,
`summary`, `priority`, `effort`, `depends_on` — is carried over from the active
item as a historical snapshot, and the close fields are added (`completed_on`,
or `removed_on`/`removed_reason`). These retained enum values are **historical**:
tooling records them as-was and does not re-validate them against the current
config (§8.3), so milestones and scales can evolve without breaking the archive.
`owner`/`collaborators` are likewise historical on closed items, so a member who
has since gone `inactive` (or left the roster) does not invalidate the archive —
though the stored value must still be a syntactically valid handle (§7.2).

### 5.2 Body

The body is free-form. Recommended sections are **Scope**, **Notes**, and
**Risks** for active items, plus a **Completed** section prepended on closeout
that summarizes what shipped and any follow-ups.

### 5.3 Dependencies

`depends_on` may reference `active` or `completed` ids (every referenced id MUST
exist somewhere), but an item SHOULD NOT be *worked* until its dependencies are
`completed`.

## 6. Effort

`effort` is **relative complexity, not time.** Canonical effort values are a
Fibonacci-like set (default `1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21`), configurable per repo. The
non-linear gaps are intentional: reaching the top of the scale is the signal to
split an item.

The number is always the stored, canonical value. Teams MAY skin it with a
custom **effort scale** for display.

### 6.1 Effort-scale config

```json
"effort": {
  "values": [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21],
  "scale": "fish",
  "scales": {
    "fish": {
      "1":  { "label": "Minnow",    "emoji": "🐟" },
      "2":  { "label": "Goldfish",  "emoji": "🐠" },
      "3":  { "label": "Trout",     "emoji": "🐡" },
      "5":  { "label": "Tuna",      "image": "assets/effort/tuna.svg" },
      "8":  { "label": "Swordfish" },
      "13": { "label": "Shark",     "emoji": "🦈" },
      "21": { "label": "Whale",     "emoji": "🐋" }
    }
  }
}
```

- `values` (required) — the canonical effort set.
- `scales` (optional) — named display scales. Each maps **every** value in
  `values` (string keys) to an entry; a value missing from the active scale is an
  error.
- `scale` (optional) — the active scale name. Absent or `"fibonacci"` selects the
  identity scale (label = the number, no emoji/image).
- Each entry: `label` (required, unique within the scale), `emoji` (optional),
  and `image` (optional, a path relative to the backlog root — `tasksDir`, default
  `trellis/` — so it resolves the same way the artifacts do). The Tuna/Swordfish
  entries above show the image-only and label-only cases.

### 6.2 Authoring and resolution

- In front-matter, `effort` MAY be the canonical number **or** a case-insensitive
  `label` from the active scale (e.g. `effort: Goldfish`). The generator resolves
  a label to its number; an unresolvable or ambiguous value is an error.
- `backlog.json` ALWAYS carries the resolved canonical number plus the resolved
  `effortLabel`, and `effortEmoji`/`effortImage` when present — so consumers
  render without reading the config.

### 6.3 Rendering

- The generated README shows `label · N` (label and number together) when a
  non-identity scale is active, and just `N` otherwise — keeping the number
  legible for velocity and rollup math.
- `label` doubles as the accessible text/alt for any `image`. SVG or emoji are
  preferred; images are optional and live under `<tasksDir>/assets/effort/`
  (default `trellis/assets/effort/`).
- The array form `effort: [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21]` is shorthand for
  `{ "values": [ … ], "scale": "fibonacci" }` and remains valid.

## 7. Configuration (`backlog.config.json`)

```json
{
  "specVersion": "2.0",
  "idPrefix": "AB",
  "idWidth": 4,
  "milestones": ["Alpha", "Beta", "v1", "Future"],
  "priorities": ["High", "Medium", "Low"],
  "effort": [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21]
}
```

| key | meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `specVersion` | the Trellis spec version this repo targets (§9) |
| `idPrefix` | id prefix (e.g. `AB`) |
| `idWidth` | zero-padded digit count |
| `milestones` | ordered milestone names (§7.1) |
| `priorities` | ordered priority names, highest first |
| `effort` | canonical values, or the effort-scale object (§6.1) |
| `tasksDir` | optional backlog-root path, repo-relative; defaults to `trellis/` |

`tasksDir` locates the task tree and the generated artifacts; omit it to accept
the `trellis/` default. The config file itself stays at `trellis/backlog.config.json`
regardless (§2) — its location is **not** governed by `tasksDir`, so the spec
example above omits the key.

**Configurable** per repo: everything in the table above, including the backlog
root via `tasksDir`. **Fixed** by the spec: the `trellis/backlog.config.json`
config location, the in-root layout (`active/`, `completed/tasks/`, `removed/`,
and the generated artifacts under `tasksDir`), the status lifecycle, the
front-matter schema, the generated-artifact contracts, and the meaning of each
field.

### 7.1 Milestones are a maturity axis

A milestone names the **release gate** an item must land in — and nothing else.
It is a single, ordered axis (e.g. `Alpha → Beta → v1 → Future`). A milestone is
**not** a feature area (that is the title), **not** a priority (its own field),
and **not** an on-hold state (§4). Milestone *names* are configured; the
single-axis, ordered semantics are fixed.

### 7.2 Team roster (`team.json`)

The optional **team roster** records who can own work. It is a separate authored
file, `team.json`, at the fixed config home (`trellis/team.json`, next to
`backlog.config.json` and independent of `tasksDir`) — kept apart from the config so
the core vocabulary stays stable while the roster (richer, faster-changing) evolves
on its own.

```json
{
  "members": [
    { "handle": "ada",  "name": "Ada Lovelace", "email": "ada@example.com", "status": "active" },
    { "handle": "alan", "name": "Alan Turing",  "status": "inactive" }
  ]
}
```

- `members` (required) — the list of people. The object wrapper leaves room for
  additive top-level keys in future minor versions.
- `handle` (required) — the stable key referenced by `owner`/`collaborators` in
  front-matter (§5.1). Constrained to `[A-Za-z0-9._-]` (so it survives the inline
  serialization of `collaborators`) and unique, case-insensitively.
- `name` (required) and `email` (optional) are **display only**.
- `status` — `active` or `inactive` (default `active`). Only **active** members may
  own or collaborate on **active** items; closed items keep historical assignees
  (§8.3), so a member can go `inactive` or leave without breaking the archive.

The roster is **optional**: an absent `team.json` is an empty roster, so a repo that
never assigns owners is unaffected. A present-but-malformed roster (bad JSON,
duplicate handle, bad `handle`/`status`, unknown member key) is a validation error
(§8.3). `handle` is the only identity contract — names/emails are not coupled to any
external identity provider; cross-repo identity is left to future work.

## 8. Generated artifacts

These are derived from the item files and config on every generator run. They
MUST be deterministic — identical inputs produce byte-identical output, with no
timestamps or other volatile fields — so that `--check` (§8.3) is stable in CI.

### 8.1 `README.md`

A human index. Item tables are emitted between the markers
`<!-- BEGIN GENERATED:MILESTONES -->` and `<!-- END GENERATED:MILESTONES -->`;
content outside the markers is author-owned and preserved. Active items are
grouped by milestone (config order) and sorted by priority then id. The block
also publishes the **Next task ID**. Text between the markers MUST NOT be
hand-edited.

The completed and removed indexes (`completed/index.md`, `removed/index.md`) are
generated the same way, each between its own `BEGIN/END GENERATED` markers, as a
table that includes the item's **summary** — completed: id, title, summary, date;
removed: id, title, summary, date, reason. Closing or removing an item is a file
move plus a generator run; index rows are never hand-added.

### 8.2 `backlog.json`

The machine contract consumers build on:

```json
{
  "prefix": "AB",
  "milestones": ["Alpha", "Beta", "v1", "Future"],
  "nextId": "AB0016",
  "counts": { "active": 14, "completed": 1, "removed": 0 },
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": "AB0042", "title": "…", "status": "active",
      "milestone": "Beta", "priority": "High",
      "effort": 5, "effortLabel": "Tuna", "effortImage": "assets/effort/tuna.svg",
      "depends_on": ["AB0007"], "owner": "ada", "collaborators": ["alan"], "summary": "…"
    }
  ]
}
```

Every entry carries the descriptive metadata (`milestone`, `summary`,
`priority`, `effort`, `depends_on`) plus `owner` (a roster handle or `null`) and
`collaborators` (handles, `[]` if none) — historical on closed entries. Completed
entries add `completed_on`; removed entries add `removed_on` and `removed_reason`.
Effort label/emoji/image fields appear when a scale is active.

### 8.3 Tooling contract

A conforming generator MUST:

1. **Validate** every item against the schema (§5), config (§7), and roster (§7.2)
   with actionable messages: id/filename match, required fields, enum membership,
   effort resolution, unique ids, `depends_on` referential integrity, and
   owner/collaborator roster membership. Enum membership (milestone/priority/effort)
   and roster **membership** (owner/collaborators must be **active** members) are
   enforced for **active** items only; on completed/removed items these values are
   historical and MUST NOT fail validation if they are no longer in the current
   config or roster (a mismatch MAY warn). `owner`/`collaborators` MUST nonetheless
   be syntactically valid handles (§7.2) on **every** item — the closed-item
   exemption is from membership, not from being a handle. A malformed `team.json` is
   a validation error regardless.
2. **Regenerate** `README.md`, the completed/removed indexes (each between its
   markers), and `backlog.json` deterministically.
3. Support a **`--check`** mode that validates and verifies the artifacts are
   current **without writing**, exiting non-zero on any error or drift. This is
   the CI gate.
4. **Warn** when `specVersion` is absent or its major version differs from the
   spec version the generator implements (§9).

## 9. Versioning and compatibility

This spec uses SemVer. A repo declares the version it targets via `specVersion`
(`major.minor`). Within a major version, changes are additive and backward
compatible; a major bump may change required fields or artifact shape. Tooling
warns on a major mismatch between `specVersion` and the implemented spec.

## 10. CI and branch protection

Conformant repositories MUST gate the default branch so the index cannot drift:

- The default branch is **protected**; changes land via pull/merge request.
- The generator's **`--check` is a required status check** that must pass before
  merge.

This is forge-agnostic — GitHub branch protection, GitLab merge-request
pipelines, Bitbucket, or Azure DevOps all satisfy it. Setup specifics are left to
the consumer's onboarding tooling.

## 11. Conformance

A repository is **Trellis-conformant** at `specVersion` *X* if its items follow
§3–§6, its `backlog.config.json` follows §7, its generated artifacts follow §8,
and its default branch is gated per §10. A **tool** is conformant if it
implements the generator contract (§8.3) for that version.
